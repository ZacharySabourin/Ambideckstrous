# Ambideckstrous

This is my current on-going project.

It's currently a REST api service that is still very limited but will function something like Scryfall. 
(This isn't supposed to be for any monetary gain or competition or anything. I'm just doing this to learn) 

This is basically a MTG card search app in it's current state. 
I will eventually add deck building features into it. 
There will also be a supplementary React app that will act as the front-end.

I am using this opportunity to fill in gaps in my knowledge and to learn some new stuff :) 
These things include:
  - Node.js
  - Docker
  - Testing with Mocha and supertest
  - Implementing TypeScript
  - Reactjs and front-end development
